                <h3>Project 1 - From Activity 04</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2 - SiX: A Summer Project</h3>
                <p>The second project was a personal project that I worked on over a summer. It wasn't finished however it has a good foundation. It is a game where everything in it is completely random and all decisions are made by a six-sided dice.
                    This is a screen shot of the title screen which would activate the game.

                <h3>Project 3 - ASCII Pokemon Game</h3>
                <p>The third project is from my 327 class. It is an ASCII game that is similiar to Pokemon. I am proud of it and it has all known pokemon in it. You start in the middle of a 400x400 grid and work your way around catching pokemon. The further you get from the middle, the harder the enemies become. It was a lot of fun to do and will always be a special project to me. </p>
